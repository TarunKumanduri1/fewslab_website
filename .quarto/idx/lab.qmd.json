She received her Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology in 2023. Currently pursuing her master’s degree, Dhanya is interested in shifting into the finance field and is taking relevant courses to achieve this goal. Her undergraduate research focused on analyzing the performance of 5G waveforms over a 3D channel model. Professionally, she is skilled in Python, data visualization using Tableau and front-end web development. Her extracurricular interests include event management at university events and photography.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n\n::: {.g-col-3}\n![ ](images/lab/abbey.jpg){width=250px height=300px}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-9}\n### **Abbey Kollar**\n\nAbbey is a doctoral student in the Systems Engineering Ph.D. program at GWU. She received her B.S. in Chemical Engineering with honors and a minor in Applied Economics from The Pennsylvania State University in 2023. Abbey’s undergraduate research focused on the conversion of plastics and biomass to oil and reducing nitrous oxide production from fertilizer use. Her research interests include renewable energy systems, climate change, economics, and policy. As a [DTAIS fellow](https://dtais.engineering.gwu.edu/), Abbey will integrate trustworthy AI into her research as well. When not in the office or class, Abbey is often found walking around the National Mall and exploring D.C.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-3}\n![ ](images/lab/tarun.jpeg){width=250px height=300px}\n:::\n\n\n::: {.g-col-9}\n### **Tarun Kumanduri**\n\nTarun is a Master’s student in the Data Analytics Program at George Washington University, having earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad in 2023. His expertise in Data Analysis, Visualization, and Modeling is enhanced by his interest in Project Management and Strategic Planning. He served as an Operations Intern in the “School Innovation Challenge 2022,” a UNICEF and Government of Telangana initiative. His undergraduate research included projects like “You Walk We Authenticate” in the Machine Learning domain and “Smart Door Receptionist” in the Internet of Things domain.

She holds a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication from the Indian Institute of Information Technology and is passionate about strategic planning, project management and advanced data analysis. Her research at the FEW’s Lab focuses on the life cycle assessment and circularity of electric vehicles, analyzing industry data, and examining their connections with policy implications. Apart from this, as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, she teaches labs on advanced Excel, SQL, and ERDs at GWU School of Business. She is also a Career Services Ambassador at GWU SEAS where she organizes events and class visits to foster student-faculty connections and develops career analysis dashboards. She interned as a Data Analyst at Infinity Automation Systems and has managed a global student exchange program as a Client Relationship Manager at AIESEC. She loves Formula One and is the author of a WordPress blog called “Constellation of Thoughts.”\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-3}\n![ ](images/lab/ji.jpg){width=250px height=300px}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-9}\n### **Ji Qi**\n\nJi is a graduate student in the Systems Engineering Ph.D. program at GWU. He received his BS in Economic Statistics from Zhengzhou University in 2020 and his MS. in Management Science and Engineering (Industrial Engineering) at Tianjin University in 2023. His past research topics mainly include the following areas: financial risk network construction, systematic risk analysis, product reliability and degradation modeling, Markov Decision Processes Based on Reinforcement Learning. He is trying to combine economy, decision science and network science in his future research. If you are interested in any of the areas mentioned above, you can contact him at ji.qi1@gwmail.gwu.edu. In his free time, he enjoys photography, hiking, and playing guitar.
