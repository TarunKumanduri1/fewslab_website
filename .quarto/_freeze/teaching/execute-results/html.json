Her pedagogy blends active learning and problem-based learning approaches, combining student-centered instruction with real-world problems. These methods emphasize critical thinking and the application of technical knowledge to transdisciplinary topics.\n\nIn recent years, she has taught and guest lectured in several courses, including:\n\n- Global Environmental Politics  \n- Communicating with Policymakers  \n- Global Sustainable Engineering  \n- Engineering Environmental Sustainability  \n- Water & Wastewater Treatment  \n- Introduction to Sustainable Water Resources  \n- Introduction to Environmental Engineering  \n\n---\n\n### Current Course Instruction\n\n#### EMSE 6740: Systems Thinking and Policy Modeling I (3 Credits)\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-9}\n\n**Institution**: The George Washington University  \n**Semester**: Every Spring  \n\nPolicy analysis with applications to business management and public policy. Topics include causal-loop diagrams, stock and flow models of business, technology adoption, and marketing. The course incorporates role-based games to explore principles of systems thinking and uses simulation to analyze complex case studies.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Past Courses Taught\n\n#### CE 360: Fluid Mechanics\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-9}\n**Institution**: Penn State University, University Park  \n**Semesters**: Fall 2017, Spring 2019, Spring 2020\n:::\n\n:::\n\n#### CE 597: Ethics, Engineering, and Environmental Management\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-9}\n**Institution**: Penn State University, University Park  \n**Semesters**: Spring 2018, Spring 2019, Spring 2020\n:::\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Ethics and Engineering Case Competitions\n\n![ ](images/teaching.png){width=100%}\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-9}\nDr. Grady has organized the Penn State Ethics and Engineering Case Competitions, sponsored by the Rock Ethics Institute. These competitions provided undergraduate students with the opportunity to explore real-world issues at the intersection of engineering and ethics. Participants developed and presented ethical solutions to contemporary challenges in engineering and business. Prizes were awarded to the top three teams.\n\n- **2017 Winners**: William “Louden” Buchanan and Steven Weber  \n- **2018 Winners**: Autumn Deitrick and Krina Patel  \n\nWhile the 2019 competition was not held, interested students should check with Dr. Grady regarding future opportunities.\n:::\n\n:::",
